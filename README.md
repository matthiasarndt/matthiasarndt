## Hello! Welcome to my Github:

#### I am an Aerospace Engineer, with experience designing and modelling high performance rockets and flight vehicles. I develop complex mathematical models and computational methods with a focus on flight physics, aerodynamics, and performance modelling.  

#### I am also a passionate Amateur Astronomer. Below are several projects that I am working on - including software developed from scratch in Python to process and identify astronomical data with Computer Vision, and a gallery featuring images I have taken of many Deep Space Objects such as nabulae, galaxies and star clusters. 

#### Please see the links to my projects below:

# [StarTrack](https://github.com/matthiasarndt/StarTrack/blob/main/README.md)

#### StarTrack is Computer Vision (CV) software developed in Python to process Astronomical data of objects in deep space - providing functionality for image processing, star detection, and noise reduction:

#### The Elephant's Trunk Nebula is found in the constellation Cepheus, and is a nebula and stellar nursery. The largest star in the vicinity is the Garnet Star (in the upper left portion of the image). 
#### This image comprises ~20GB of data, captured over 11 hours of total exposure, and processed into a final image.

#### To capture this data, I use an apochromatic refractor on a motorised equatorial mount. Click the link above for more!
