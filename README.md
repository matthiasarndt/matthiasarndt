### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a Senior Engineer at MBDA, where I work on the next generation of high-performance rockets and flight vehicles. In my role, I develop complex mathematical models and computational methods with a focus on flight physics, aerodynamics, and performance modelling. I enjoy contributing to high impact projects, taking the initiative, and solving complex problems. 

In my free time, I am avid astronomer. Below are several astronomy related projects that I have undertaken - including a Python package developed from scratch to process and identify astronomical data, and a gallery showing the images I have taken of many astronomical objects in deep space. 

### Please see the links to my projects below:

# [StarTrack](https://github.com/matthiasarndt/StarTrack/blob/main/README.md)

StarTrack is a Python package providing functionality for Astronomical image stacking, processing, star detection, and noise reduction:

# [Astrophotography](https://github.com/matthiasarndt/Astrophotography/blob/main/README.md)

Each imaged is composed of many hours of 1–3-minute exposures which have been combined to boost the final images’ signal to noise ratio. 
My equipment is summarised below: 
*	An apochromatic refractor telescope with a focal length of 360mm and a focal ratio of 5.8. 
*	A mount which can track the night sky in the Right Ascension (RA) axis.
*	A Nikon DSLR which has been modified to increase sensitivity to Hydrogen Alpha wavelengths.
