### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a Senior Engineer at MBDA, where I work on the next generation of high-performance rockets and flight vehicles. In my role, I develop complex mathematical models and computational methods with a focus on flight physics, aerodynamics, and performance modelling. I enjoy contributing to high impact projects, taking the initiative, and solving complex problems. 

In my free time, I am avid astronomer. Below are several astronomy related projects that I have undertaken - including a Python package developed from scratch to process and identify astronomical data, and a gallery showing the images I have taken of many astronomical objects in deep space. 

### Please see the links to my projects below:

# [StarTrack](https://github.com/matthiasarndt/StarTrack/blob/main/README.md)

StarTrack is a Python package providing functionality for Astronomical image stacking, processing, star detection, and noise reduction:
