## Hello! Welcome to my Github:

### I am an Aerospace Engineer, with experience designing and modelling high performance rockets and flight vehicles. I develop complex mathematical models and computational methods with a focus on flight physics, aerodynamics, and performance modelling.  

### In my free time, I am avid astronomer. Below are several astronomy projects that I have worked on - including a software developed from scratch in Python to process and identify astronomical data, and a gallery with images I have taken of many Deep Space Objects such as nabulae, galaxies and star clusters. 

### Please see the links to my projects below:

# [StarTrack](https://github.com/matthiasarndt/StarTrack/blob/main/README.md)

### StarTrack is Computer Vision (CV) software developed in Python to process Astronomical data of objects in deep space - providing functionality for image processing, star detection, and noise reduction:

### Each imaged is composed of many hours of 1–3-minute exposures which have been combined to boost the final images’ signal to noise ratio. 
My equipment is summarised below: 
*	An apochromatic refractor telescope with a focal length of 360mm and a focal ratio of 5.8. 
*	A mount which can track the night sky in the Right Ascension (RA) axis.
*	A Nikon DSLR which has been modified to increase sensitivity to Hydrogen Alpha wavelengths.
